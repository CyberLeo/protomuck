If it is set to #-1 or an invalid user, muf cgi scripts won't
execute. 'me @' in MUF programs called from the webserver will
return this player's dbref. Setting this player = DARK and
PARENT will enable LOGWALLED wizards to see a lot more status
log for browser connections to the MUCK.

out of RAM.
~~
secure_who
Prevents using WHO from the login screen.
~~
who_doing
In-server WHO will display the @doing list from the _/do prop on
players.
~~
realms_control
Makes it so that if a parent room is set WIZARD, the owner of that
parent room becomes a like a 'wizard' for all objects within that
parent room.  NOTE: As of Proto 2.0b4, if the new tune wiz_realms
is off, players are allowed to set B on their own environments to
give it realms control.  Also see "CONTROLS" flag in help
~~~
wiz_realms
Only means anything if realms_control is on.  If set on, this tune
restricts realms control to wizards setting them on rooms. If set
off, then any player can set BUILDER on their environment and get
realms control.  This also applies to those who pass the chown lock
if CONTROLS is also set on the environment room.

~~
old_priorities
With this defined to 1, exits that aren't on TYPE_THING objects will
always act as if they have at least a Priority Level of 1.
Define this if you want to use this server with an old db, and don't
want to re-set the Levels of all the LOOK, DISCONNECT, and CONNECT 
actions.
~~
do_mpi_parsing
Turning this off prevents text from being sent through the MPI parser.
~~
look_propqueues
Turning this on allows _look/ propqueue hooks.
~~
lock_envcheck
Turning this on allows locks to check down the environment for props.
~~
diskbase_propvals
Turning this on causes the server to only load props when they are
being used, otherwise they are not stored in RAM. Slows down the 
MUCK but makes it more memory efficient.
~~
idleboot
Turning this on will boot players once they reach maxidle.
~~
playermax
Turning this on will enforce the max_players @tune by booting
players who connect once the limit has been reached.
~~
db_readonly
Turning this on prevents most changes to be made to the data base. 
@newpasswording and @frobbing can still be done, however.
~~
building
Setting this to no will disable the in-server building commands, such
as @create, @dig, @open.
~~
all_can_build_rooms
Turning this to yes allows even players with no BUILDER bit to make
rooms.
~~
restricted_building
Setting this to yes prevents players from making anything unless they
have a BUILDER flag. Is overridden by the all_can_build_rooms option.
~~
allow_home
Setting this to no disables the in-server home command.
~~
enable_idle_msgs
If this is enabled, then the room will be notified with a message if a player 
goes idle, or becomes unidle.
~~
user_idle_propqueue
If enabled, this will allow _Idle/ and _Unidle to be used, so that not just 
administration can set this propdir.
~~
quiet_moves
Setting this to yes turns off the '%N has arrived/left.' messages 
when players enter or leave rooms.
~~
expanded_debug
Setting this to yes causes the MUF debugger to display the contents
of MUF arrays.  It also expands the strings.
~~
proplist_int_counter
Used to specify whether the system standard for proplist storage is
to use integer or string props for the counter.
~~
proplist_entry_fmt

the string will be replaced by the proplist name. Any instance of N in the 
string will be replaced by the item's number. The default is "P#/N".
~~
proplist_counter_fmt
Used to display the system standard naming format for proplists. This string 
specifies the format of the namee of the property that the count of list items 
is stored in. Any instance of P will be replaced by the proplist name. The 
default is "P#".
~~
enable_mcp
Setting this to no turns off the MCP version indicator upon connection.
However, it also disables the use of MCP all together. 
~~
enable_commandprops
Setting this to yes turns on command prop support. Setting it to no shuts off 
the command prop support.
~~
old_parseprop
When set to 'no', the parseprop prim gets its permissions from the
object on which the prop to be parsed is located. When set to 'yes',
the parseprop prim gets its permissions from the permission bit set
on the MUF program itself.
~~~
pcreate_copy_props
Setting this to yes will make it so that newly made players will have the
props on the player_prototype copied to them at @pcreation time.
~~~
quiet_connects
Setting this to yes will shut off the '%N has connected/disconnected.' 
messages.
~~~
mpi_needflag
Setting this to yes will make it so that players and objects must have the
MEEPER bit in order to parse MPI. When a player has been given a MEEPER
bit, they can then set the MEEPER bit on things they own, thus enabling
those objects to active MPI parsing as well.
~~~
guest_needflag
When set to yes, any player marked G will only be able to enter rooms
that have been set with the GUEST flag. When set to no, then players 
with the G flag will be unable to enter rooms set with the GUEST flag.
~~~
mortalwho
When set to yes, wizards have to use WHO ! in order to see wiz-who.
When set to no, wizards will see wiz-WHO by default.
~~~
fb_controls
When set to yes, all wizards over W2 have control over just about
everything on the MUCK. When set to no, the MUCK runs under Neon
Wiz permissions, in which case, no wiz has control over objects
owned by a higher wiz level. For example, W3's would not pass a
'controls' check for an object owned by a W4.
~~~
allow_old_trigs
Setting this to no disables all _ prefixed propqueues. For example, 
_connect, _disconnect, etc., will not work if this is set to no.
Setting it to yes leaves all of those propqueues enabled.
~~~~
auto_archive
Setting this to 'no' shuts down all use of the @autoarchive support,
either by the command or by the @tune. Setting it to yes allows W4
and above to run @autoarchive and to set the archive_interval
@tune setting. 
See: 'help @autoarchive' for details.
~~~~
default_parent
Set this to the room that the in-server @dig should select when no
alternative parent room is located when a new room is made.
~~~
min_progbreak_lev
This determines the lowest level that can use the @Q command to 
break a foreground program. W2 and above can always do it.
~~~
mcp_muf_lev
This determines the M level that a player must have to write 
programs that take advantage of MCP related prims.
~~~
multi_wizlevels
This @tune can turn off tiered wiz levels. With it on, there
will be W5/W4/W3/W2/W1 (The Neon/Glow scheme). Turning it off
will make it so that there is only #1/W (Fuzzball scheme).
~~~
optimize_muf
Turning this on enables the byte-code optimizer when compiling
MUF programs. MUF optimization can be turned off on a program
by program basis by setting the program = N.
~~~
dump_propqueues
This enables a @dumpwarn and @dump propqueue to be used on #0.
~~~
mysql_result_limit
Restricts the number of rows that can be returned from
the SQLQUERY prim. Should never set this to over 2000.
If not working with SQL and MUF, don't worry about
this setting.
~~~
socket_events
Turn on MUF Socket events. Allows MUF programs to catch
socket events via EVENT_WAITFOR. If you do not know what
this is, you may just leave it off.
~~~
logwall_www
Turns off all Webserver logwalling to cut down on lots
of webserver related spam.
~~~
compatible_muf_perms
Tuning this on, will change the permissions model for MUF so
that MUF runs at the level of the bit set on it by default,
SETUID runs at the owner of the of the program, HARDUID runs 
at the level of owner of the trigger of the program, and 
QUELL will run it at the permissions of the calling player.
This is as per FB/Glow behaviour.  If you are running a FB
or glow database, best to set this ON, if a Neon or Proto DB
set it off.
~~~
max_wiz_preempt_count
Sets a hard max instruction count on PREEMPT programs that not 
even wiz-owned programs can exceed. If left at 0, there is no
max limit for PREEMPT programs running under Mage permissions
or higher.
~~~
unidle_command
This is a string that players can enter into the MUCK without
actually unidling. Designed to allow players to set up unidle
triggers to keep connections behind routers and firewalls from
getting dropped when they idle. If they set up an idle trigger
that sends the word that this @tune setting is set to, then
they can keep their connection from dropping without unidling
their characters on the MUCK. Note that whatever this command
is, it does not get processed as input by the player, so do not
use anything that is already a command players can use. The
allow_unidle @tune option must be set to yes.
~~~
allow_unidle
Allows players to use whatever the unidle_command is set to
without making their character unidle. See the information under
'@tune unidle_command' for an explanation. 
~~~
alt_infinity_handler
Turns on IEEE style handling of infinity and not_a_number 
conditions, so that inf 5 + returns inf (instead of zero), 3 asin 
returns nan (not 0).  
Also errors are only flagged if the inf or nan returned would be
an unexpected result, so inf 5 + does not return an error, but
inf sin returns nan with an error.  This makes it reasonably safe
to use floats without checking if you triggered an error when you
get a zero result, since all error conditions return either inf
(for true floating point overflows) or nan (for 'not a number'
conditions.
~~~
wizhidden_access_bit
Values 1-5 change the level of bit it takes to access wizhidden
'@' props, W1 (Mage) to W5(the MAN).  Read and Write are given.
~~~~~
userflag_name
This is a string that will give the MOBILE flag, an alternate
name.  You may then set and test for this flag by the name you
enter here, and it will be displayed as such in 'examine'.  You
may use this if your MUCK requires a flag for its own use.  The
'userflag' has no effect on anything it is set on except as 
defined in your MUF.  In all cases, you may still test for the
userflag using MOBILE, OFFER, or ?, and it parses to '?' in
your dbref.  Also see the 'userflag_mlev' tune and 'help mobile'.
~~~
userflag_mlev
This is the minimum mlevel a player must be or a program must be
running at to change the userflag (MOBILE).  Change this if your
MUCK uses the userflags for its own purposes, and you dont want
unpriveleged players changing it.  Also see the tune 
'username_flag'.
