                   *ProtoMUCK MUF Editor Help*
While in the MUF editor, the following commands are available:

These commands are used to work with the program text:
----------------
compile             (c)     compile program
<num> [<num>]delete (d)     delete a single line or range of lines
<num> insert        (i)     insert at the line number given
<num> [<num>]list   (l)     list a single line, or a range of lines
uncompile           (u)     serves no point in current MUCK versions
numbers             (n)     toggle line numbers in program listings
public              (p)     list the PUBLIC functions of program
.                   (.)     enter . to exit insert mode
quit                (q)     to quit out of the editor

These commands are used to work with the global MUF macros:
----------------
abridged [<letter>] (a)     list global MUF macros by name only
<macro name> kill   (k)     remove a global MUF macro (W1 Command)
show [<letter>]     (s)     list a full display of global MUF macros
<num> view          (v)     to list the given program's header

All editor commands may be abbreviated to their first letter.

To define a macro, use the following syntax:
def <macro name> <macro definition>
Then that macro may be used in any MUF program as:  .<macro name>

def sample me @ "Sample Macro" notify
would create a macro that notifies the user that string and is called
by using .sample in a MUF.
Be careful when defining a macro, as only w-bitted characters can
delete or change them.
